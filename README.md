## Project Overview
This project analyzes student participation in various events based on a dataset that includes information such as student demographics, academic performance, and event details. The goal is to derive insights into student behavior and preferences, which can be beneficial for future event planning and student engagement strategies.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `First Name`
- `Email ID`
- `Quantity`
- `Events`
- `Attendee Status`
- `College Name`
- `How did you come to know about this event?`
- `Specify in "Others" (how did you come to know about this event)`
- `Designation`
- `Year of Graduation`
- `City`
- `CGPA`
- `Experience with Python (Months)`
- `Family Income`
- `Expected Salary (Lac)`
- `Leadership Skills`

## Questions Addressed
1. How many unique students are included in the dataset?
2. What is the average GPA of the students?
3. What is the distribution of students across different graduation years?
4. What is the distribution of students' experience with Python programming?
5. What is the average family income of the students?
6. How does the GPA vary among different colleges? (Show top 5 results only)
7. Are there any outliers in the quantity (number of courses completed) attribute?
8. What is the average GPA for students from each city?
9. Can we identify any relationship between family income and GPA?
10. How many students are there from various cities?
11. How does the expected salary vary based on factors like GPA, Family Income, Experience with Python (Months)?
12. Which event tends to attract more students from specific fields of study?
13. Do students in leadership positions during their college years tend to have higher GPAs or better expected salaries?
14. How many students are graduating by the end of 2024?
15. Which promotion channel brings in more student participation for the event?
16. Find the total number of students who attended events related to Data Science.
17. Do students with high CGPA and more experience have higher salary expectations?
18. How many students know about the event from their colleges? Which are the Top 5 colleges?
